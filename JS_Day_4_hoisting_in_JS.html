    <!-- Hoisting 
    
        we can declared variable after used
        we can used variable before declartion

        i.e JS Variable have by default behavior that variable declartion goes to the top of scope
    

        The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:


        *******************************************************************

        Declare Your Variables At the Top !

Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.

If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).

To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.

Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.

JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not declared.
Study "use strict" in the next chapter.

        "use strict";

        // JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted


        // var is a hoisted

        a = 10;
        console.log(a);//
        var a;


        // **************************************************************

        // let and const are not hoisted

        // skill = "ReactJS";
        // console.log(skill);
